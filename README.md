# QueensAgricultureProgram_4
CISC 282 | Website for a faux QueensU agriculture program

This website was created as an assignmnt for CISC 282 Web Development at Queens Univeristy

Some key featured I'd like to point out:
- mobile-first responsive design
- header animation (a new hero images fades in and out)
- a gallery implemented using magnific popup library
